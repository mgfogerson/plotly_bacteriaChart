For this Plotly assignment, I used the D3 and Plotly libraries to chart medical data from a JSON file relating to bellybutton bacteria samples. This project required the ability to reload data from a specified index and repopulate multiple charts, all showing different details of the same dataset. This is especially helpful as it allows for a specific query to be responsively represented from the whole, and select a specific way to graphically display each type of information appropriately. Population charts, for instance, can be handled differently than frequency or other information.
  In JavaScript, I pushed all of the items to be charted into individual arrays inside a data object, and then used an event listener and selector menu to pull and repopulate the charts based on the index number in the selector. When the page loads, it starts at index 0, or the first patient.
